Warning: The "Remove" Button in Qt git branches dialog is dangerous!
    it does `git branch -D [branch]` which deletes the branch regardless of its merged state!

Data transfer between classes

Lifetime of data: Data is transferred via Qt's Signals and Slots mechanism. Since all QObjects
are created in the same thread and not moved, connection of signals does
not specify a connection type. Qt::AutoConnection makes Qt use Qt::DirectConnection.
This makes Slot be called directly and executred in the signalling thread, no
need to worry about the objects that are passes as arguments being deleted before
the Slot is done.

Time spent copying data: To keep copying time low, objects are passed by reference.

Information encapsulation: To secure that the source data is not modified through
the reference, the reference will be to const data.
