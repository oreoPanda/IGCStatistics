Reason: new architecture needed

StatisticsView and Statistic contain too many functions

Statistic generates data in form of QLineSeries
- for each type of data there is a private function
- one slot to request certain data generation which emits a signal
- types of data can be stored in enum in Statistic.h
- classes that want to use Statistic need to include Statistic.h

StatisticView shows data
- can inherit QChartView
- its chart can contain series of data (for cool, smooth looking series, use QSplineSeries!)
- the name of the series can be used for switching as user requests
- check out: QAbstractSeries::useOpenGL

UI
- tabbed window containing for example either a QTabBar or a QTabWidget
- in one tab there should be a StatisticView
- one tab should include general data from the top part of the igc file (H records probably)

I have big plans for this repository!! This is a new branch where they will be implemented into code!!

idea: the active data is greyed out in combobox
